A deterioration in a company-specific factor can significantly drop the price of an asset for an extended period, possibly regardless of a generally positive market trend, which may negatively affect the Sub-Fund and the investor [0].\n\n2. **High-Yield Investments Risk**: These are Debt Securities that are either rated non-investment grade or are unrated but presumed to be non-investment grade. High-yield investments are normally associated with a higher degree of creditworthiness risk, risk of interest rate changes, general market risk, company-specific risk, and liquidity risk compared to higher-rated, lower-yielding securities. Increased risks can adversely impact the Sub-Fund and investors [1].\n\n3. **Sustainability Risk**: Pertains to environmental, social, or governance events or conditions that could materially negatively impact the value of an investment. Sustainability risks may materialize as issuer-specific extreme loss-risks, which typically occur infrequently but may have a high financial impact and can significantly lead to financial loss. Such risks have the potential to negatively influence the performance of investment portfolios and are considered potential drivers of financial risk factors like market price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk [2].\n\n4. **Concentration Risk**: Arises if a Sub-Fund focuses its investments on certain markets, types of investments, specific countries, regions, or industries, reducing diversification. This may make the Sub-Fund more dependent on the development of these specific investments or markets, thereby making it more volatile than more diversified funds. It may be more susceptible to value fluctuations resulting from a limited number of holdings or the impact of adverse conditions on a particular investment or market, which could adversely affect the performance of the Sub-Fund and investors' investments [3].\n Source document:\n[0] Company-Specific Risk\nThe value of a Sub-Fund\u2019s as... from prospectus_exemple_3_1.pdf\n[1] High-Yield Investments Risk\nHigh-yield investments... from prospectus_exemple_3_1.pdf\n[2] Sustainability Risk\nmeans an environmental social ... from prospectus_exemple_3_1.pdf\n[3] Concentration Risk\nIf a Sub-Fund focuses its inves... from prospectus_exemple_3_1.pdf"}}
